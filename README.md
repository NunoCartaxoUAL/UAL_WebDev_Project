# UAL_WebDev_Project
## Vinyl Shop Website
This project was done as part of a university module. The website is built using Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It features a vinyl shop where users can create an account, login, and purchase vinyl records. The admin page allows for the deletion of users or products.

## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with Node.js and web development. I learned how to create a vinyl shop website with a responsive user interface using CSS and HTML. I also gained experience in implementing basic user authentication, allowing users to create an account and log in. Additionally, I learned how to store data in a file-based database.

While the project achieved its intended learning goals, there are a few limitations due to the scope of the project. The database used in the project is just a file, which could be replaced with a real database for a more scalable solution. 

## Project Limitations
I must note that due to the scope of the project, there are some limitations and shortcuts taken. For example, some functionalities, such as adding or deleting products, are only available through the admin page. Additionally, the file-based database may not be the most efficient solution for a real-world application.

Despite these limitations, I am proud of what I was able to accomplish and the skills I gained throughout the project.
